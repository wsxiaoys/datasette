commits added since the last release.

CSV export
~~~~~~~~~~

Any Datasette table, view or custom SQL query can now be exported as CSV.

.. image:: advanced_export.png

Check out the :ref:`CSV export documentation <csv_export>` for more details, or
try the feature out on
https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight/bechdel%2Fmovies

If your table has more than :ref:`config_max_returned_rows` (default 1,000)
Datasette provides the option to *stream all rows*. This option takes advantage
of async Python and Datasette's efficient :ref:`pagination <pagination>` to
iterate through the entire matching result set and stream it back as a
downloadable CSV file.

Foreign key expansions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Datasette detects a foreign key reference it attempts to resolve a label
for that reference (automatically or using the :ref:`label_columns` metadata
option) so it can display a link to the associated row.

This expansion is now also available for JSON and CSV representations of the
table, using the new ``_labels=on`` querystring option. See
:ref:`expand_foreign_keys` for more details.

New configuration settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datasette's :ref:`config` now also supports boolean settings. A number of new
configuration options have been added:

* ``num_sql_threads`` - the number of threads used to execute SQLite queries. Defaults to 3.
* ``allow_facet`` - enable or disable custom :ref:`facets` using the `_facet=` parameter. Defaults to on.
* ``suggest_facets`` - should Datasette suggest facets? Defaults to on.
* ``allow_download`` - should users be allowed to download the entire SQLite database? Defaults to on.
* ``allow_sql`` - should users be allowed to execute custom SQL queries? Defaults to on.
* ``default_cache_ttl`` - Default HTTP caching max-age header in seconds. Defaults to 365 days - caching can be disabled entirely by settings this to 0.
* ``cache_size_kb`` - Set the amount of memory SQLite uses for its `per-connection cache <https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size>`_, in KB.
* ``allow_csv_stream`` - allow users to stream entire result sets as a single CSV file. Defaults to on.
* ``max_csv_mb`` - maximum size of a returned CSV file in MB. Defaults to 100MB, set to 0 to disable this limit.

Control HTTP caching with ?_ttl=
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now customize the HTTP max-age header that is sent on a per-URL basis, using the new ``?_ttl=`` querystring parameter.

You can set this to any value in seconds, or you can set it to 0 to disable HTTP caching entirely.

Consider for example this query which returns a randomly selected member of the Avengers::

    select * from [avengers/avengers] order by random() limit 1

If you hit the following page repeatedly you will get the same result, due to HTTP caching:

`/fivethirtyeight?sql=select+*+from+%5Bavengers%2Favengers%5D+order+by+random%28%29+limit+1 <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight?sql=select+*+from+%5Bavengers%2Favengers%5D+order+by+random%28%29+limit+1>`_

By adding `?_ttl=0` to the zero you can ensure the page will not be cached and get back a different super hero every time:

`/fivethirtyeight?sql=select+*+from+%5Bavengers%2Favengers%5D+order+by+random%28%29+limit+1&_ttl=0 <https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight?sql=select+*+from+%5Bavengers%2Favengers%5D+order+by+random%28%29+limit+1&_ttl=0>`_

Improved support for SpatiaLite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `SpatiaLite module <https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index>`_
for SQLite adds robust geospatial features to the database.

Getting SpatiaLite working can be tricky, especially if you want to use the most
recent alpha version (with support for K-nearest neighbor).

Datasette now includes :ref:`extensive documentation on SpatiaLite
<spatialite>`, and thanks to `Ravi Kotecha <https://github.com/r4vi>`_ our GitHub
repo includes a `Dockerfile
<https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/master/Dockerfile>`_ that can build
the latest SpatiaLite and configure it for use with Datasette.

The ``datasette publish`` and ``datasette package`` commands now accept a new
``--spatialite`` argument which causes them to install and configure SpatiaLite
as part of the container they deploy.

latest.datasette.io
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every commit to Datasette master is now automatically deployed by Travis CI to
https://latest.datasette.io/ - ensuring there is always a live demo of the
latest version of the software.

The demo uses `the fixtures
<https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/master/tests/fixtures.py>`_ from our
unit tests, ensuring it demonstrates the same range of functionality that is
covered by the tests.

You can see how the deployment mechanism works in our `.travis.yml
<https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/master/.travis.yml>`_ file.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Got JSON data in one of your columns? Use the new ``?_json=COLNAME`` argument
  to tell Datasette to return that JSON value directly rather than encoding it
  as a string.
* If you just want an array of the first value of each row, use the new
  ``?_shape=arrayfirst`` option - `example
  <https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures.json?sql=select+neighborhood+from+facetable+order+by+pk+limit+101&_shape=arrayfirst>`_.

0.22.1 (2018-05-23)
-------------------

Bugfix release, plus we now use `versioneer <https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer>`_ for our version numbers.

- Faceting no longer breaks pagination, fixes `#282 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/282>`_
- Add ``__version_info__`` derived from `__version__` [Robert Gieseke]

  This might be tuple of more than two values (major and minor
  version) if commits have been made after a release.
- Add version number support with Versioneer. [Robert Gieseke]

  Versioneer Licence:
  Public Domain (CC0-1.0)

  Closes `#273 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/273>`_
- Refactor inspect logic [Russ Garrett]

0.22 (2018-05-20)
-----------------

The big new feature in this release is :ref:`facets`. Datasette can now apply faceted browse to any column in any table. It will also suggest possible facets. See the `Datasette Facets <https://simonwillison.net/2018/May/20/datasette-facets/>`_ announcement post for more details.

In addition to the work on facets:

- Added `docs for introspection endpoints <https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introspection.html>`_

- New ``--config`` option, added ``--help-config``, closes `#274 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/274>`_

  Removed the ``--page_size=`` argument to ``datasette serve`` in favour of::

      datasette serve --config default_page_size:50 mydb.db

  Added new help section::

      $ datasette --help-config
      Config options:
        default_page_size            Default page size for the table view
                                     (default=100)
        max_returned_rows            Maximum rows that can be returned from a table
                                     or custom query (default=1000)
        sql_time_limit_ms            Time limit for a SQL query in milliseconds
                                     (default=1000)
        default_facet_size           Number of values to return for requested facets
                                     (default=30)
        facet_time_limit_ms          Time limit for calculating a requested facet
                                     (default=200)
        facet_suggest_time_limit_ms  Time limit for calculating a suggested facet
                                     (default=50)
- Only apply responsive table styles to ``.rows-and-column``

  Otherwise they interfere with tables in the description, e.g. on
  https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight/nba-elo%2Fnbaallelo

- Refactored views into new ``views/`` modules, refs `#256 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/256>`_
- `Documentation for SQLite full-text search <http://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/full_text_search.html>`_ support, closes `#253 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/253>`_
- ``/-/versions`` now includes SQLite ``fts_versions``, closes `#252 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/252>`_

0.21 (2018-05-05)
-----------------

New JSON ``_shape=`` options, the ability to set table ``_size=`` and a mechanism for searching within specific columns.

- Default tests to using a longer timelimit

  Every now and then a test will fail in Travis CI on Python 3.5 because it hit
  the default 20ms SQL time limit.

  Test fixtures now default to a 200ms time limit, and we only use the 20ms time
  limit for the specific test that tests query interruption. This should make
  our tests on Python 3.5 in Travis much more stable.
- Support ``_search_COLUMN=text`` searches, closes `#237 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/237>`_
- Show version on ``/-/plugins`` page, closes `#248 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/248>`_
- ``?_size=max`` option, closes `#249 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/249>`_
- Added ``/-/versions`` and ``/-/versions.json``, closes `#244 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/244>`_

  Sample output::

      {
        "python": {
          "version": "3.6.3",
          "full": "3.6.3 (default, Oct  4 2017, 06:09:38) \n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.37)]"
        },
        "datasette": {
          "version": "0.20"

          "extensions": {
            "json1": null,
            "spatialite": "4.3.0a"
          }
        }
      }
- Renamed ``?_sql_time_limit_ms=`` to ``?_timelimit``, closes `#242 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/242>`_
- New ``?_shape=array`` option + tweaks to ``_shape``, closes `#245 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/245>`_

  * Default is now ``?_shape=arrays`` (renamed from ``lists``)
  * New ``?_shape=array`` returns an array of objects as the root object
  * Changed ``?_shape=object`` to return the object as the root
  * Updated docs

- FTS tables now detected by ``inspect()``, closes `#240 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/240>`_
- New ``?_size=XXX`` querystring parameter for table view, closes `#229 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/229>`_

  Also added documentation for all of the ``_special`` arguments.

  Plus deleted some duplicate logic implementing ``_group_count``.
- If ``max_returned_rows==page_size``, increment ``max_returned_rows`` - fixes `#230 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/230>`_
- New ``hidden: True`` option for table metadata, closes `#239 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/239>`_
- Hide ``idx_*`` tables if spatialite detected, closes `#228 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/228>`_
- Added ``class=rows-and-columns`` to custom query results table
- Added CSS class ``rows-and-columns`` to main table
- ``label_column`` option in ``metadata.json`` - closes `#234 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/234>`_

0.20 (2018-04-20)
-----------------

Mostly new work on the :ref:`plugins` mechanism: plugins can now bundle static assets and custom templates, and ``datasette publish`` has a new ``--install=name-of-plugin`` option.

- Add col-X classes to HTML table on custom query page
- Fixed out-dated template in documentation
- Plugins can now bundle custom templates, `#224 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/224>`_
- Added /-/metadata /-/plugins /-/inspect, `#225 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/225>`_
- Documentation for --install option, refs `#223 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/223>`_
- Datasette publish/package --install option, `#223 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/223>`_
- Fix for plugins in Python 3.5, `#222 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/222>`_
- New plugin hooks: extra_css_urls() and extra_js_urls(), `#214 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/214>`_
- /-/static-plugins/PLUGIN_NAME/ now serves static/ from plugins
- <th> now gets class="col-X" - plus added col-X documentation
- Use to_css_class for table cell column classes

  This ensures that columns with spaces in the name will still
  generate usable CSS class names. Refs `#209 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/209>`_
- Add column name classes to <td>s, make PK bold [Russ Garrett]
- Don't duplicate simple primary keys in the link column [Russ Garrett]

  When there's a simple (single-column) primary key, it looks weird to
  duplicate it in the link column.

  This change removes the second PK column and treats the link column as
  if it were the PK column from a header/sorting perspective.
- Correct escaping for HTML display of row links [Russ Garrett]
- Longer time limit for test_paginate_compound_keys

  It was failing intermittently in Travis - see `#209 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/209>`_
- Use application/octet-stream for downloadable databses
- Updated PyPI classifiers
- Updated PyPI link to pypi.org

0.19 (2018-04-16)
-----------------

This is the first preview of the new Datasette plugins mechanism. Only two
plugin hooks are available so far - for custom SQL functions and custom template
filters. There's plenty more to come - read `the documentation
<https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html>`_ and get involved in
`the tracking ticket <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/14>`_ if you
have feedback on the direction so far.

- Fix for ``_sort_desc=sortable_with_nulls`` test, refs `#216 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/216>`_

- Fixed `#216 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/216>`_ - paginate correctly when sorting by nullable column

- Initial documentation for plugins, closes `#213 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/213>`_

  https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html

- New ``--plugins-dir=plugins/`` option (`#212 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/212>`_)

  New option causing Datasette to load and evaluate all of the Python files in
  the specified directory and register any plugins that are defined in those
  files.

  This new option is available for the following commands::

      datasette serve mydb.db --plugins-dir=plugins/
      datasette publish now/heroku mydb.db --plugins-dir=plugins/
      datasette package mydb.db --plugins-dir=plugins/

- Start of the plugin system, based on pluggy (`#210 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/14>`_)

  Uses https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/ originally created for the py.test project

  We're starting with two plugin hooks:

  ``prepare_connection(conn)``

  This is called when a new SQLite connection is created. It can be used to register custom SQL functions.

  ``prepare_jinja2_environment(env)``

  This is called with the Jinja2 environment. It can be used to register custom template tags and filters.

  An example plugin which uses these two hooks can be found at https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-demos or installed using ``pip install datasette-plugin-demos``

  Refs `#14 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/14>`_

- Return HTTP 405 on InvalidUsage rather than 500. [Russ Garrett]

  This also stops it filling up the logs. This happens for HEAD requests
  at the moment - which perhaps should be handled better, but that's a
  different issue.


0.18 (2018-04-14)
-----------------

This release introduces `support for units <http://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metadata.html#specifying-units-for-a-column>`_,
contributed by Russ Garrett (`#203 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/203>`_).
You can now optionally specify the units for specific columns using ``metadata.json``.
Once specified, units will be displayed in the HTML view of your table. They also become
available for use in filters - if a column is configured with a unit of distance, you can
request all rows where that column is less than 50 meters or more than 20 feet for example.

- Link foreign keys which don't have labels. [Russ Garrett]

  This renders unlabeled FKs as simple links.

  Also includes bonus fixes for two minor issues:

  * In foreign key link hrefs the primary key was escaped using HTML
    escaping rather than URL escaping. This broke some non-integer PKs.
  * Print tracebacks to console when handling 500 errors.

- Fix SQLite error when loading rows with no incoming FKs. [Russ
  Garrett]

  This fixes ``ERROR: conn=<sqlite3.Connection object at 0x10bbb9f10>, sql
  = 'select ', params = {'id': '1'}`` caused by an invalid query when
  loading incoming FKs.

  The error was ignored due to async but it still got printed to the
  console.

- Allow custom units to be registered with Pint. [Russ Garrett]
- Support units in filters. [Russ Garrett]
- Tidy up units support. [Russ Garrett]

  * Add units to exported JSON
  * Units key in metadata skeleton
  * Docs

- Initial units support. [Russ Garrett]

  Add support for specifying units for a column in ``metadata.json`` and
  rendering them on display using
  `pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_


0.17 (2018-04-13)
-----------------
- Release 0.17 to fix issues with PyPI


0.16 (2018-04-13)
-----------------
- Better mechanism for handling errors; 404s for missing table/database

  New error mechanism closes `#193 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/193>`_

  404s for missing tables/databases closes `#184 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/184>`_

- long_description in markdown for the new PyPI
- Hide Spatialite system tables. [Russ Garrett]
- Allow ``explain select`` / ``explain query plan select`` `#201 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/201>`_
- Datasette inspect now finds primary_keys `#195 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/195>`_
- Ability to sort using form fields (for mobile portrait mode) `#199 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/199>`_

  We now display sort options as a select box plus a descending checkbox, which
  means you can apply sort orders even in portrait mode on a mobile phone where
  the column headers are hidden.

0.15 (2018-04-09)
-----------------

The biggest new feature in this release is the ability to sort by column. On the
table page the column headers can now be clicked to apply sort (or descending
sort), or you can specify ``?_sort=column`` or ``?_sort_desc=column`` directly
in the URL.

- ``table_rows`` => ``table_rows_count``, ``filtered_table_rows`` =>
  ``filtered_table_rows_count``

  Renamed properties. Closes `#194 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/194>`_

- New ``sortable_columns`` option in ``metadata.json`` to control sort options.

  You can now explicitly set which columns in a table can be used for sorting
  using the ``_sort`` and ``_sort_desc`` arguments using ``metadata.json``::

      {
          "databases": {
              "database1": {
                  "tables": {
                      "example_table": {
                          "sortable_columns": [
                              "height",
                              "weight"
                          ]
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }

  Refs `#189 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/189>`_

- Column headers now link to sort/desc sort - refs `#189 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/189>`_

- ``_sort`` and ``_sort_desc`` parameters for table views

  Allows for paginated sorted results based on a specified column.

  Refs `#189 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/189>`_

- Total row count now correct even if ``_next`` applied

- Use .custom_sql() for _group_count implementation (refs `#150 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/150>`_)

- Make HTML title more readable in query template (`#180 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/180>`_) [Ryan Pitts]

- New ``?_shape=objects/object/lists`` param for JSON API (`#192 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/192>`_)

  New ``_shape=`` parameter replacing old ``.jsono`` extension

  Now instead of this::

      /database/table.jsono

  We use the ``_shape`` parameter like this::

      /database/table.json?_shape=objects

  Also introduced a new ``_shape`` called ``object`` which looks like this::

      /database/table.json?_shape=object

  Returning an object for the rows key::

      ...
      "rows": {
          "pk1": {
              ...
          },
          "pk2": {
              ...
          }
      }

  Refs `#122 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/122>`_

- Utility for writing test database fixtures to a .db file

  ``python tests/fixtures.py /tmp/hello.db``

  This is useful for making a SQLite database of the test fixtures for
  interactive exploration.

- Compound primary key ``_next=`` now plays well with extra filters

  Closes `#190 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/190>`_

- Fixed bug with keyset pagination over compound primary keys

  Refs `#190 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/190>`_

- Database/Table views inherit ``source/license/source_url/license_url``
  metadata

  If you set the ``source_url/license_url/source/license`` fields in your root
  metadata those values will now be inherited all the way down to the database
  and table templates.

  The ``title/description`` are NOT inherited.

  Also added unit tests for the HTML generated by the metadata.

  Refs `#185 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/185>`_

- Add metadata, if it exists, to heroku temp dir (`#178 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/178>`_) [Tony Hirst]
- Initial documentation for pagination
- Broke up test_app into test_api and test_html
- Fixed bug with .json path regular expression

  I had a table called ``geojson`` and it caused an exception because the regex
  was matching ``.json`` and not ``\.json``

- Deploy to Heroku with Python 3.6.3

0.14 (2017-12-09)
-----------------

The theme of this release is customization: Datasette now allows every aspect
of its presentation `to be customized <http://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom_templates.html>`_
either using additional CSS or by providing entirely new templates.

Datasette's `metadata.json format <http://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metadata.html>`_
has also been expanded, to allow per-database and per-table metadata. A new
``datasette skeleton`` command can be used to generate a skeleton JSON file
ready to be filled in with per-database and per-table details.

The ``metadata.json`` file can also be used to define
`canned queries <http://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sql_queries.html#canned-queries>`_,
as a more powerful alternative to SQL views.

- ``extra_css_urls``/``extra_js_urls`` in metadata

  A mechanism in the ``metadata.json`` format for adding custom CSS and JS urls.

  Create a ``metadata.json`` file that looks like this::

      {
          "extra_css_urls": [
              "https://simonwillison.net/static/css/all.bf8cd891642c.css"
          ],
          "extra_js_urls": [
              "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js"
          ]
      }

  Then start datasette like this::

      datasette mydb.db --metadata=metadata.json

  The CSS and JavaScript files will be linked in the ``<head>`` of every page.

  You can also specify a SRI (subresource integrity hash) for these assets::

      {
          "extra_css_urls": [
              {
                  "url": "https://simonwillison.net/static/css/all.bf8cd891642c.css",
                  "sri": "sha384-9qIZekWUyjCyDIf2YK1FRoKiPJq4PHt6tp/ulnuuyRBvazd0hG7pWbE99zvwSznI"
              }
          ],
          "extra_js_urls": [
              {
                  "url": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js",
                  "sri": "sha256-k2WSCIexGzOj3Euiig+TlR8gA0EmPjuc79OEeY5L45g="
              }
          ]
      }

  Modern browsers will only execute the stylesheet or JavaScript if the SRI hash
  matches the content served. You can generate hashes using https://www.srihash.org/

- Auto-link column values that look like URLs (`#153 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/153>`_)

- CSS styling hooks as classes on the body (`#153 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/153>`_)

  Every template now gets CSS classes in the body designed to support custom
  styling.

  The index template (the top level page at ``/``) gets this::

      <body class="index">

  The database template (``/dbname/``) gets this::

      <body class="db db-dbname">

  The table template (``/dbname/tablename``) gets::

      <body class="table db-dbname table-tablename">

  The row template (``/dbname/tablename/rowid``) gets::

      <body class="row db-dbname table-tablename">

  The ``db-x`` and ``table-x`` classes use the database or table names themselves IF
  they are valid CSS identifiers. If they aren't, we strip any invalid
  characters out and append a 6 character md5 digest of the original name, in
  order to ensure that multiple tables which resolve to the same stripped
  character version still have different CSS classes.

  Some examples (extracted from the unit tests)::

      "simple" => "simple"
      "MixedCase" => "MixedCase"
      "-no-leading-hyphens" => "no-leading-hyphens-65bea6"
      "_no-leading-underscores" => "no-leading-underscores-b921bc"
      "no spaces" => "no-spaces-7088d7"
      "-" => "336d5e"
      "no $ characters" => "no--characters-59e024"

- ``datasette --template-dir=mytemplates/`` argument

  You can now pass an additional argument specifying a directory to look for
  custom templates in.

  Datasette will fall back on the default templates if a template is not
  found in that directory.

- Ability to over-ride templates for individual tables/databases.

  It is now possible to over-ride templates on a per-database / per-row or per-
  table basis.

  When you access e.g. ``/mydatabase/mytable`` Datasette will look for the following::

      - table-mydatabase-mytable.html
      - table.html

  If you provided a ``--template-dir`` argument to datasette serve it will look in
  that directory first.

  The lookup rules are as follows::

      Index page (/):
          index.html

      Database page (/mydatabase):
          database-mydatabase.html
          database.html

      Table page (/mydatabase/mytable):
          table-mydatabase-mytable.html
          table.html

      Row page (/mydatabase/mytable/id):
          row-mydatabase-mytable.html
          row.html

  If a table name has spaces or other unexpected characters in it, the template
  filename will follow the same rules as our custom ``<body>`` CSS classes
  - for example, a table called "Food Trucks"
  will attempt to load the following templates::

      table-mydatabase-Food-Trucks-399138.html
      table.html

  It is possible to extend the default templates using Jinja template
  inheritance. If you want to customize EVERY row template with some additional
  content you can do so by creating a row.html template like this::

      {% extends "default:row.html" %}

      {% block content %}
      <h1>EXTRA HTML AT THE TOP OF THE CONTENT BLOCK</h1>
      <p>This line renders the original block:</p>
      {{ super() }}
      {% endblock %}

- ``--static`` option for datasette serve (`#160 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/160>`_)

  You can now tell Datasette to serve static files from a specific location at a
  specific mountpoint.

  For example::

    datasette serve mydb.db --static extra-css:/tmp/static/css

  Now if you visit this URL::

    http://localhost:8001/extra-css/blah.css

  The following file will be served::

    /tmp/static/css/blah.css

- Canned query support.

  Named canned queries can now be defined in ``metadata.json`` like this::

      {
          "databases": {
              "timezones": {
                  "queries": {
                      "timezone_for_point": "select tzid from timezones ..."
                  }
              }
          }
      }

  These will be shown in a new "Queries" section beneath "Views" on the database page.

- New ``datasette skeleton`` command for generating ``metadata.json`` (`#164 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/164>`_)

- ``metadata.json`` support for per-table/per-database metadata (`#165 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/165>`_)

  Also added support for descriptions and HTML descriptions.

  Here's an example metadata.json file illustrating custom per-database and per-
  table metadata::

      {
          "title": "Overall datasette title",
          "description_html": "This is a <em>description with HTML</em>.",
          "databases": {
              "db1": {
                  "title": "First database",
                  "description": "This is a string description & has no HTML",
                  "license_url": "http://example.com/",
              "license": "The example license",
                  "queries": {
                    "canned_query": "select * from table1 limit 3;"
                  },
                  "tables": {
                      "table1": {
                          "title": "Custom title for table1",
                          "description": "Tables can have descriptions too",
                          "source": "This has a custom source",
                          "source_url": "http://example.com/"
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }

- Renamed ``datasette build`` command to ``datasette inspect`` (`#130 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/130>`_)

- Upgrade to Sanic 0.7.0 (`#168 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/168>`_)

  https://github.com/channelcat/sanic/releases/tag/0.7.0

- Package and publish commands now accept ``--static`` and ``--template-dir``

  Example usage::

      datasette package --static css:extra-css/ --static js:extra-js/ \
        sf-trees.db --template-dir templates/ --tag sf-trees --branch master

  This creates a local Docker image that includes copies of the templates/,
  extra-css/ and extra-js/ directories. You can then run it like this::

    docker run -p 8001:8001 sf-trees

  For publishing to Zeit now::

    datasette publish now --static css:extra-css/ --static js:extra-js/ \
      sf-trees.db --template-dir templates/ --name sf-trees --branch master

- HTML comment showing which templates were considered for a page (`#171 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/171>`_)

0.13 (2017-11-24)
-----------------
- Search now applies to current filters.

  Combined search into the same form as filters.

  Closes `#133`_

- Much tidier design for table view header.

  Closes `#147`_

- Added ``?column__not=blah`` filter.

  Closes `#148`_

- Row page now resolves foreign keys.

  Closes `#132`_

- Further tweaks to select/input filter styling.

  Refs `#86`_ - thanks for the help, @natbat!

- Show linked foreign key in table cells.

- Added UI for editing table filters.

  Refs `#86`_

- Hide FTS-created tables on index pages.

  Closes `#129`_

- Add publish to heroku support [Jacob Kaplan-Moss]

  ``datasette publish heroku mydb.db``

  Pull request `#104`_

- Initial implementation of ``?_group_count=column``.

  URL shortcut for counting rows grouped by one or more columns.

  ``?_group_count=column1&_group_count=column2`` works as well.

  SQL generated looks like this::

      select "qSpecies", count(*) as "count"
      from Street_Tree_List
      group by "qSpecies"
      order by "count" desc limit 100

  Or for two columns like this::

      select "qSpecies", "qSiteInfo", count(*) as "count"
      from Street_Tree_List
      group by "qSpecies", "qSiteInfo"
      order by "count" desc limit 100

  Refs `#44`_

- Added ``--build=master`` option to datasette publish and package.

  The ``datasette publish`` and ``datasette package`` commands both now accept an
  optional ``--build`` argument. If provided, this can be used to specify a branch
  published to GitHub that should be built into the container.

  This makes it easier to test code that has not yet been officially released to
  PyPI, e.g.::

      datasette publish now mydb.db --branch=master

- Implemented ``?_search=XXX`` + UI if a FTS table is detected.

  Closes `#131`_

- Added ``datasette --version`` support.

- Table views now show expanded foreign key references, if possible.

  If a table has foreign key columns, and those foreign key tables have
  ``label_columns``, the TableView will now query those other tables for the
  corresponding values and display those values as links in the corresponding
  table cells.

  label_columns are currently detected by the ``inspect()`` function, which looks
  for any table that has just two columns - an ID column and one other - and
  sets the ``label_column`` to be that second non-ID column.

- Don't prevent tabbing to "Run SQL" button (`#117`_) [Robert Gieseke]

  See comment in `#115`_

- Add keyboard shortcut to execute SQL query (`#115`_) [Robert Gieseke]

- Allow ``--load-extension`` to be set via environment variable.

- Add support for ``?field__isnull=1`` (`#107`_) [Ray N]

- Add spatialite, switch to debian and local build (`#114`_) [Ariel Núñez]

- Added ``--load-extension`` argument to datasette serve.

  Allows loading of SQLite extensions. Refs `#110`_.

0.12 (2017-11-16)
-----------------
- Added ``__version__``, now displayed as tooltip in page footer (`#108`_).
- Added initial docs, including a changelog (`#99`_).
- Turned on auto-escaping in Jinja.
- Added a UI for editing named parameters (`#96`_).

  You can now construct a custom SQL statement using SQLite named
  parameters (e.g. ``:name``) and datasette will display form fields for
  editing those parameters. `Here’s an example`_ which lets you see the
  most popular names for dogs of different species registered through
  various dog registration schemes in Australia.

.. _Here’s an example: https://australian-dogs.now.sh/australian-dogs-3ba9628?sql=select+name%2C+count%28*%29+as+n+from+%28%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22Animal+name%22%29+as+name+from+%5BAdelaide-City-Council-dog-registrations-2013%5D+where+Breed+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28Animal_Name%29+as+name+from+%5BAdelaide-City-Council-dog-registrations-2014%5D+where+Breed_Description+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all+%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28Animal_Name%29+as+name+from+%5BAdelaide-City-Council-dog-registrations-2015%5D+where+Breed_Description+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22AnimalName%22%29+as+name+from+%5BCity-of-Port-Adelaide-Enfield-Dog_Registrations_2016%5D+where+AnimalBreed+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22Animal+Name%22%29+as+name+from+%5BMitcham-dog-registrations-2015%5D+where+Breed+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22DOG_NAME%22%29+as+name+from+%5Bburnside-dog-registrations-2015%5D+where+DOG_BREED+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all+%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22Animal_Name%22%29+as+name+from+%5Bcity-of-playford-2015-dog-registration%5D+where+Breed_Description+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0Aunion+all%0D%0A%0D%0Aselect+upper%28%22Animal+Name%22%29+as+name+from+%5Bcity-of-prospect-dog-registration-details-2016%5D+where%22Breed+Description%22+like+%3Abreed%0D%0A%0D%0A%29+group+by+name+order+by+n+desc%3B&breed=pug

- Pin to specific Jinja version. (`#100`_).
- Default to 127.0.0.1 not 0.0.0.0. (`#98`_).
- Added extra metadata options to publish and package commands. (`#92`_).

  You can now run these commands like so::

      datasette now publish mydb.db \
          --title="My Title" \
          --source="Source" \
          --source_url="http://www.example.com/" \
          --license="CC0" \
          --license_url="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"

  This will write those values into the metadata.json that is packaged with the
  app. If you also pass ``--metadata=metadata.json`` that file will be updated with the extra
  values before being written into the Docker image.
- Added simple production-ready Dockerfile (`#94`_) [Andrew
  Cutler]
- New ``?_sql_time_limit_ms=10`` argument to database and table page (`#95`_)
- SQL syntax highlighting with Codemirror (`#89`_) [Tom Dyson]

0.11 (2017-11-14)
-----------------
- Added ``datasette publish now --force`` option.

  This calls ``now`` with ``--force`` - useful as it means you get a fresh copy of datasette even if Now has already cached that docker layer.
- Enable ``--cors`` by default when running in a container.

0.10 (2017-11-14)
-----------------
- Fixed `#83`_ - 500 error on individual row pages.
- Stop using sqlite WITH RECURSIVE in our tests.

  The version of Python 3 running in Travis CI doesn't support this.

.. _#83: https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/83

0.9 (2017-11-13)
----------------
- Added ``--sql_time_limit_ms`` and ``--extra-options``.

  The serve command now accepts ``--sql_time_limit_ms`` for customizing the SQL time
  limit.

  The publish and package commands now accept ``--extra-options`` which can be used
  to specify additional options to be passed to the datasite serve command when
  it executes inside the resulting Docker containers.

0.8 (2017-11-13)
----------------
- V0.8 - added PyPI metadata, ready to ship.
- Implemented offset/limit pagination for views (`#70`_).
- Improved pagination. (`#78`_)
- Limit on max rows returned, controlled by ``--max_returned_rows`` option. (`#69`_)

  If someone executes 'select * from table' against a table with a million rows
  in it, we could run into problems: just serializing that much data as JSON is
  likely to lock up the server.

  Solution: we now have a hard limit on the maximum number of rows that can be
  returned by a query. If that limit is exceeded, the server will return a
  ``"truncated": true`` field in the JSON.

  This limit can be optionally controlled by the new ``--max_returned_rows``
  option. Setting that option to 0 disables the limit entirely.
